  caveats <<~EOS
    Novex is open-source and NOT notarized (no paid Apple Developer ID), so macOS
    will warn on first launch. Either:
      • right-click Novex.app → Open → Open, or
      • run:  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Novex.app"

    Novex reads Mail on-device and needs Full Disk Access:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → enable Novex.

    The AI features need an Apple Silicon Mac on macOS 26+ with Apple
    Intelligence enabled. Everything is on-device — your mail never leaves your Mac.
