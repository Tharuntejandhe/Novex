///  1. `sanitize` — strip control chars, cap length, and neutralize the most
///     common injection lead-ins so they don't read as commands.
///  2. `fence` — wrap the untrusted text in explicit "this is DATA" delimiters.
///  3. The model instructions (see BriefingService) tell it to never follow
///     instructions found inside an email.
///
/// Blast radius is already limited (on-device, no tool calls, deep-links use the
/// real Message-ID not model text) — this protects the one remaining surface: the
/// summary/answer TEXT the user trusts.
